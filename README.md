# NPLAY-Bot

This bot was created specifically for the Discord [server](https://discord.gg/qcpeZQhJf5) of the german YouTuber and Twitch Streamer [nordrheintvplay](https://www.youtube.com/user/nordrheintvplay). The core feature of this bot is a leveling system, similar to Mee6, but with a high level of customization. Besides 3 currencies that can be collected, there are 13 items that all bring different functions and advantages. In addition, there are various temporary events, daily rewards and many other useful features.

## Test Server

The bot is in constant development. Join the test [server](https://discord.gg/JYWezvQ) to receive regular updates, make suggestions and test preview versions. This is also the place to get support if you want to host the bot by yourself.
